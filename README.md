# LuckyLink App

LuckyLink is a Laravel-based app for generating one-time game links.
Players receive a random number and can win a prize based on configurable win rules.
Each link expires after a set time, but users can regenerate a new one if needed.
Expired links are automatically deactivated, and users can view the history of their recent attempts.
